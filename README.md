# Simple Shooter
## Description
Simple 3D shooter game inspired by old-school games. The objective of this project is to experiment and learn more about Unity, rather than to make a game. 

The main goal of this project is to focus on getting a better handle on architecting the game's code, such as use of modular and extensible Scriptable Object workflow rather than MonoBehaviours. Other goals include learning about more previously unexplored aspects of the Unity engine's toolset and/or more-or-less recently added features. Currently, these include learning the differences of using URP over the default render pipeline, using the new UI Toolkit for in-game UI and experimenting with in-engine tool development if an opportunity arises.

Used engine: Unity 2020.3.20f1 (Personal license)
